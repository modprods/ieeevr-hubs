All of the rooms will see the same content, but you will only be able to interact with people in the same room as you.

                            <br />To choose a room, scroll to the bottom of the page where you will see a list of rooms and how many people are in each (out of the 20 person max). We encourage you to coordinate with your friends to choose a room that can fit your group so you can enjoy the experience together. Once you’ve decided on a room, click “Join” to enter.
